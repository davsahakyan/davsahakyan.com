        <p>
            Back in 2017, I got into recreating websites I found online on my computer, and to this day, I am still
            working towards coding anything and everything possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Up to this day, I have had a chance to build websites for an <span class="bold">NGO</span>, develop
            middleware for an
            <span class="bold">advertising agency</span>, build hundreds of <span class="bold">ad banners</span> for
            clients worldwide, and much more. Recetnly I
            have been working as a freelanceer, while studying for a Computer Science degree.

        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am getting into full-stack development. I am using <span class="bold">Node.js</span> for
            back-end, and <span class="bold">Nuxt.js</span> for front-end.
